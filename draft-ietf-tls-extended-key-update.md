--- abstract

TLS 1.3 ensures forward secrecy by performing an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange
during the initial handshake, protecting past communications even if a party's
long-term keys are later compromised. While the built-in KeyUpdate mechanism allows
traffic keys to be refreshed during a session, it does not introduce new forward-secret
key material. This limitation can pose a security risk in long-lived sessions, such as
those found in industrial IoT or telecommunications environments.

To address this, this specification defines an extended key update mechanism that
performs a fresh Diffie-Hellman exchange within an active session, thereby
re-establishing forward secrecy beyond the initial handshake. By forcing attackers
to exfiltrate new key material repeatedly, this approach mitigates the risks
associated with static key compromise. Regular renewal of session keys helps
contain the impact of such compromises. The extension is applicable to both TLS 1.3
and DTLS 1.3.

#  Introduction

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 protocol provides forward secrecy by using
an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) key exchange during the initial handshake. This
ensures that encrypted communication remains confidential even if an attacker
later obtains a party's long-term private key, protecting against passive adversaries
who record encrypted traffic for later decryption.

TLS 1.3 also includes a KeyUpdate mechanism that allows traffic keys to be refreshed
during an established session. However, this mechanism does not introduce new
forward-secret key material, as it applies only a key derivation function to the
previous application traffic secret as input. While this design is generally sufficient
for short-lived connections, it may present security limitations in scenarios where
sessions persist for extended periods, such as in industrial IoT or telecommunications
systems, where continuous availability is critical and session renegotiation or resumption
is impractical.

Earlier versions of TLS supported session renegotiation, which allowed peers to negotiate
fresh keying material, including performing new Diffie-Hellman exchanges during the
session lifetime. Due to protocol complexity and known vulnerabilities, renegotiation
was first restricted by {{RFC5746}} and ultimately removed in TLS 1.3. While the
KeyUpdate message was introduced to offer limited rekeying functionality, it does
not fulfill the same cryptographic role as renegotiation and cannot refresh
long-term secrets or derive new secrets from fresh DHE input.

Security guidance from national agencies, such as ANSSI (France), recommends the
periodic renewal of cryptographic keys during long-lived sessions to limit the
impact of key compromise. This approach encourage designs designs that force an
attacker to perform dynamic key exfiltration, as defined in {{RFC7624}}. Dynamic
key exfiltration refers to attack scenarios where an adversary must repeatedly
extract fresh keying material to maintain access to protected data, increasing
operational cost and risk for the attacker. In contrast, static key exfiltration,
where a long-term secret is extracted once and reused, poses a greater long-term
threat, especially when session keys are not refreshed with forward-secret input.

This specification defines a TLS extension that introduces an extended key update
mechanism. Unlike the standard KeyUpdate, this mechanism allows peers to perform a
fresh Diffie-Hellman exchange within an active session using one of the groups
negotiated during the initial handshake. By periodically rerunning (EC)DHE, this
extension enables the derivation of new traffic secrets that are independent of
prior key material. As noted in Appendix F of {{I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}, this
approach mitigates the risk of static key exfiltration and shifts the attacker
burden toward dynamic key exfiltration.

The proposed extension is applicable to both TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3. For clarity,
the term "TLS" is used throughout this document to refer to both protocols unless
otherwise specified.

# Terminology and Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 {{RFC2119}}.

To distinguish the key update procedure defined in {{I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}
from the key update procedure specified in this document, we use the terms
"key update" and "extended key update", respectively.

# Negotiating the Extended Key Update

Client and servers use the TLS flags extension
{{I-D.ietf-tls-tlsflags}} to indicate support for the functionality
defined in this document.  We call this the "extended_key_update"
extension and the corresponding flag is called "Extended_Key_Update"
flag.

The "Extended_Key_Update" flag proposed by the client in the
ClientHello (CH) MUST be acknowledged in the EncryptedExtensions
(EE), if the server also supports the functionality defined in this
document and is configured to use it.

If the "Extended_Key_Update" flag is not set, servers ignore any of the
functionality specified in this document and applications that
require perfect forward security will have to initiate a full
handshake.

# Extended Key Update Message {#ext-key-update}

The ExtendedKeyUpdate handshake message is used to indicate an update
of cryptographic keys. This key update process can be sent by either
peer after it has sent a Finished message.  Implementations that
receive a ExtendedKeyUpdate message prior to receiving a Finished
message MUST terminate the connection with an "unexpected_message"
alert.

The KeyShareEntry in the ExtendedKeyUpdate message MUST be the same
group mutually supported by the client and server during the initial
handshake. The peers MUST NOT send a KeyShareEntry in the ExtendedKeyUpdate
message that is not mutually supported by the client and server during
the initial handshake. An implementation that receives any other value
MUST terminate the connection with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

{{fig-key-update}} shows the interaction graphically.
First, support for the functionality in this specification
is negotiated in the ClientHello and the EncryptedExtensions
messages. Then, the ExtendedKeyUpdate exchange is sent to
update the application traffic secrets.

The extended key update exchange is performed between the initiator and the
responder whereby the initiator may be the TLS client or the TLS server.

The structure of the ExtendedKeyUpdate message is shown below.

~~~
struct {
  KeyShareEntry key_share;
} ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest;

enum {
  accepted(0),
  retry(1),
  rejected(2),
  clashed(3),
  (255)
} ExtendedKeyUpdateResponseStatus;

struct {
  ExtendedKeyUpdateResponseStatus status;
  select (ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse.status) {
     case accepted: KeyShareEntry key_share;
     case retry: uint8 delay;
  }
} ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse;

struct {
} NewKeyUpdate;
~~~

key_share:  Key share information.  The contents of this field
  are determined by the specified group and its corresponding
  definition. The structures are defined in {{I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.

status:  Response to ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest. This status field indicates
  whether responder accepted or declined Extended Key Update Request.

delay:  Delay in seconds for the initiator to retry the request.

There are three rejection reasons defined:

1. `retry`: request was declined temporarily as responder is too busy.
In this case ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse contains delay in seconds for initiator
to retry. Initiator MUST NOT retry within this interval and SHOULD retry after
it lapsed. Note that responder MAY apply an overall rate limit to extended key
update that would not be specific to given TLS session. If initiator cannot
proceed without immediate Extended Key Update it MUST terminate the connection
with TLS alert "extended_key_update_required" (alert number TBD).

2. `rejected`: request was declined permanently. Initiator MUST NOT retry and
if it cannot proceed without Extended Key Update it MUST terminate the
connection with alert "extended_key_update_required" (alert number TBD).

3. `clashed`: request was declined because responder already initiated its own
extended key update.

The exchange has the following steps:

1. Initiator sends a ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest message, which contains
a key share. While an extended key update is in progress, the initiator
MUST NOT initiate further key updates.

2. On receipt of the ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest message, the responder
sends the ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse message. If the responder accepts the
request, it sets the status to `accepted` and includes its own key share.
If the responder declines the request, it sets the status accordingly and
does not include the key share. While an extended key update is in progress,
the responder MUST NOT initiate further key updates.

3. On receipt of the ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse message with `accepted` status,
the initiator is able to derive a secret key based on the exchanged key shares.
The NewKeyUpdate message is intentionally an empty structure that triggers
the transition to new keying material.

5. On receipt of the NewKeyUpdate message by the responder, it MUST update
its receive keys. In response, the responder transmits a NewKeyUpdate message
and MUST update its sending keys.

6. After receiving the NewKeyUpdate message from the responder, the initiator
MUST update its traffic keys and MUST send all its traffic using the next
generation of keys.

Both sender and receiver MUST encrypt their NewKeyUpdate messages with
the old keys. Both sides MUST ensure that the NewKeyUpdate encrypted
with the old key is received before accepting any messages encrypted
with the new key.

If TLS peers independently initiate the extended key update
procedure and the requests cross in flight, the ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest
message with the lower lexicographic order for the key_exchange value
in the KeyShareEntry will be rejected by the responder using `clashed` status
in ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse message. This approach prevents each side incrementing
keys by two generations.

{: #fig-handshake title="Handshake Structure."}

The ExtendedKeyUpdate and the KeyUpdates MAY be used in combination
over the lifetime of a TLS communication session, depending on the
desired security properties.

# Updating Traffic Secrets {#key_update}

When the extended key update message exchange is completed both peers
have successfully updated their application traffic secrets. The
key derivation function described in this document is used to perform
this update.

The design of the key derivation function for computing the next generation
of application_traffic_secret is motivated by the desire to include

* a secret derived from the (EC)DHE exchange (or from the hybrid key exchange
/ PQ-KEM exchange),
* a secret that allows the new key exchange to be cryptographally bind
the previously established secret to the newly derived secret,
* the concatenation of the ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest and the
ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse messages, which contain the key shares, binding
the encapsulated shared secret ciphertext to IKM in case of hybrid key
exchange, providing MAL-BIND-K-CT security (see {{CDM23}}), and
* new label strings to distinguish it from the key derivation used in
TLS 1.3.

The following diagram shows the key derivation hierarchy.

~~~
       Master Secret N
             |
             v
       Derive-Secret(., "key derived", "")
             |
             v
 (EC)DHE -> HKDF-Extract = Master Secret N+1
             |
             +-----> Derive-Secret(., "c ap traffic2",
             |                ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest ||
             |                ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse)
             |                = client_application_traffic_secret_N+1
             |
             +-----> Derive-Secret(., "s ap traffic2",
             |                ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest ||
             |                ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse)
             |                = server_application_traffic_secret_N+1
             |
             +-----> Derive-Secret(., "exp master2",
             |                ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest ||
             |                ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse)
             |                = exporter_master_secret_N+1
             |
             +-----> Derive-Secret(., "res master2",
             |                ExtendedKeyUpdateRequest ||
             |                ExtendedKeyUpdateResponse))
                              = resumption_master_secret_N+1
~~~

During the initial handshake the Master Secret is generated, see
{{Section 7.1 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}. Since the Master Secret
is discarded during the key derivation procedure, a derived value is
stored. This value then serves as input to another key derivation step
that takes the (EC)DHE-established value as a second parameter into
account.

The traffic keys are re-derived from client_application_traffic_secret_N+1
and server_application_traffic_secret_N+1, as described in
{{Section 7.3 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.

Once client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N+1 and its associated
traffic keys have been computed, implementations SHOULD delete
client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N and its associated
traffic keys as soon as possible. Note: The
client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N and its associated
traffic keys can only be deleted after receiving the NewKeyUpdate message.

When using this extension, it is important to consider its interaction with
ticket-based session resumption. If resumption occurs without a new (EC)DH
exchange that provides forward secrecy, an attacker could potentially revert
the security context to an earlier state, thereby negating the benefits of
the extended key update. To preserve the security guarantees provided by key
updates, endpoints MUST either invalidate any session tickets issued prior
to the key update or ensure that resumption always involves a fresh (EC)DH
exchange.

# Example

{{fig-key-update}} shows the interaction between a TLS 1.3 client
and server graphically. This section shows an example message exchange
where a client updates its sending keys.

There are two phases:

1. The support for the functionality in this specification
is negotiated in the ClientHello and the EncryptedExtensions
messages.

2. Once the initial handshake is completed, a key update can be
triggered.

{{fig-key-update2}} provides an overview of the exchange starting
with the initial negotiation followed by the key update.

#  DTLS 1.3 Considerations

Due to the possibility of a NewKeyUpdate message being lost and
thereby preventing the sender of the NewKeyUpdate message
from updating its keying material, receivers MUST retain the
pre-update keying material until receipt and successful decryption
of a message using the new keys.

Due to loss and/or reordering, DTLS 1.3 implementations may receive a
record with an older epoch than the current one. They SHOULD attempt to
process those records with that epoch but MAY opt to discard
such out-of-epoch records.

# Post-Quantum Cryptography Considerations

Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms
simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing
security even if all but one of the component algorithms is broken.
The transition to post-quantum cryptography motivates the introduction
of hybrid key exchanges to TLS, as described in
{{I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design}}. When the hybrid key exchange is used,
then the key_exchange field of a KeyShareEntry in the initial exchange
is the concatenation of the key_exchange field for each of the algorithms.
The same approach is then re-used in the extended key update when
key shares are exchanged.

# SSLKEYLOGFILE update

As Extended Key Update invalidates previous secrets, SSLKEYLOGFILE {{I-D.ietf-tls-keylogfile}} needs to
be populated with new entries. Each completed Extended Key Update results
in two additional secret labels in SSLKEYLOGFILE:

1. `CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_N+1`: identified as client_application_traffic_secret_N+1 in the key schedule

2. `SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_N+1`: identified as server_application_traffic_secret_N+1 in the key schedule

Similarly to other records in SSLKEYLOGFILE label is followed by 32-byte value
of the Random field from the ClientHello message that established the TLS
connection and corresponding secret encoded in hexadecimal.

SSLKEYLOGFILE entries for Extended Key Update MUST NOT be produced if
SSLKEYLOGFILE was not used for other secrets in the handshake.

Note that each successful Extended Key Update invalidates all previous SSLKEYLOGFILE secrets including
past iterations of `CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_` and `SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_`.

# Exporter

Protocols like DTLS-SRTP and DTLS-over-SCTP utilize TLS or DTLS for key establishment but repurpose
some of the keying material for their own purpose. These protocols use the TLS exporter defined in
{{Section 7.5 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.

Once the Extended Key Update mechanism is complete, such protocols would need to use the newly
derived key to generate Exported Keying Material (EKM) to protect packets. The "sk" derived in the
{{key_update}} will be used as the "Secret" in the exporter function, defined in
{{Section 7.5 of I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}, to generate EKM, ensuring that the exported keying
material is aligned with the updated security context.
