       Extended Key Update for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3
               draft-ietf-tls-extended-key-update-latest

Abstract

   TLS 1.3 ensures forward secrecy by performing an ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman key exchange during the initial handshake, protecting past
   communications even if a party's long-term keys are later
   compromised.  While the built-in KeyUpdate mechanism allows traffic
   keys to be refreshed during a session, it does not introduce new
   forward-secret key material.  This limitation can pose a security
   risk in long-lived sessions, such as those found in industrial IoT or
   telecommunications environments.

   To address this, this specification defines an extended key update
   mechanism that performs a fresh Diffie-Hellman exchange within an
   active session, thereby re-establishing forward secrecy beyond the
   initial handshake.  By forcing attackers to exfiltrate new key
   material repeatedly, this approach mitigates the risks associated
   with static key compromise.  Regular renewal of session keys helps
   contain the impact of such compromises.  The extension is applicable
   to both TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3.

1.  Introduction

   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 protocol provides forward
   secrecy by using an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) key exchange
   during the initial handshake.  This ensures that encrypted
   communication remains confidential even if an attacker later obtains
   a party's long-term private key, protecting against passive
   adversaries who record encrypted traffic for later decryption.

   TLS 1.3 also includes a KeyUpdate mechanism that allows traffic keys
   to be refreshed during an established session.  However, this
   mechanism does not introduce new forward-secret key material, as it
   applies only a key derivation function to the previous application
   traffic secret as input.  While this design is generally sufficient
   for short-lived connections, it may present security limitations in
   scenarios where sessions persist for extended periods, such as in
   industrial IoT or telecommunications systems, where continuous
   availability is critical and session renegotiation or resumption is
   impractical.

   Earlier versions of TLS supported session renegotiation, which
   allowed peers to negotiate fresh keying material, including
   performing new Diffie-Hellman exchanges during the session lifetime.
   Due to protocol complexity and known vulnerabilities, renegotiation
   was first restricted by [RFC5746] and ultimately removed in TLS 1.3.
   While the KeyUpdate message was introduced to offer limited rekeying
   functionality, it does not fulfill the same cryptographic role as
   renegotiation and cannot refresh long-term secrets or derive new
   secrets from fresh DHE input.

   Security guidance from national agencies, such as ANSSI (France),
   recommends the periodic renewal of cryptographic keys during long-
   lived sessions to limit the impact of key compromise.  This approach
   encourages designs that force an attacker to perform dynamic key
   exfiltration, as defined in [RFC7624].  Dynamic key exfiltration
   refers to attack scenarios where an adversary must repeatedly extract
   fresh keying material to maintain access to protected data,
   increasing operational cost and risk for the attacker.  In contrast,
   static key exfiltration, where a long-term secret is extracted once
   and reused, poses a greater long-term threat, especially when session
   keys are not refreshed with forward-secret input.

   This specification defines a TLS extension that introduces an
   extended key update mechanism.  Unlike the standard key update, this
   mechanism allows peers to perform a fresh Diffie-Hellman exchange
   within an active session using one of the groups negotiated during
   the initial handshake.  By periodically rerunning (EC)DHE, this
   extension enables the derivation of new traffic secrets that are
   independent of prior key material.  As noted in Appendix F of
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis], this approach mitigates the risk of static
   key exfiltration and shifts the attacker burden toward dynamic key
   exfiltration.

   The proposed extension is applicable to both TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3.
   For clarity, the term "TLS" is used throughout this document to refer
   to both protocols unless otherwise specified.

2.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   To distinguish the key update procedure defined in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis] from the key update procedure specified in
   this document, we use the terms "standard key update" and "extended
   key update", respectively.

3.  Negotiating the Extended Key Update

   Client and servers use the TLS flags extension
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tlsflags] to indicate support for the functionality
   defined in this document.  We call this the "extended_key_update"
   extension and the corresponding flag is called "Extended_Key_Update"
   flag.

   The "Extended_Key_Update" flag proposed by the client in the
   ClientHello (CH) MUST be acknowledged in the EncryptedExtensions
   (EE), if the server also supports the functionality defined in this
   document and is configured to use it.

   If the "Extended_Key_Update" flag is not set, servers ignore any of
   the functionality specified in this document and applications that
   require perfect forward security will have to initiate a full
   handshake.

4.  Extended Key Update Messages

   If the client and server agree to use the extended key update
   mechanism, the standard key update MUST NOT be used.  In this case,
   the extended key update fully replaces the standard key update
   functionality.

   Implementations that receive a classic KeyUpdate message after
   successfully negotiating the Extended Key Update functionality MUST
   terminate the connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.

   The extended key update is carried in a single handshake message
   named ExtendedKeyUpdate, with an internal subtype indicating its role
   (request, response, or new key update).  The extended key update
   process can be initiated by either peer after it has sent a Finished
   message.  Implementations that receive an ExtendedKeyUpdate message
   prior to the sender having sent Finished MUST terminate the
   connection with an "unexpected_message" alert.

   The KeyShareEntry carried in a ExtendedKeyUpdate(request) and in a
   ExtendedKeyUpdate(response) MUST use a group that was mutually
   supported by the client and server during the initial handshake.  An
   implementation that receives an algorithm not previously negotiated
   MUST terminate the connection with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

   Figure 1 shows the interaction graphically.  First, support for the
   functionality in this specification is negotiated in the ClientHello
   and the EncryptedExtensions messages.  Then, the ExtendedKeyUpdate
   exchange is sent to update the application traffic secrets.

   The extended key update exchange is performed between the initiator
   and the responder; either the TLS client or the TLS server may act as
   initiator.

   The ExtendedKeyUpdate wire format is:

      new_key_update(2),
      (255)
   } ExtendedKeyUpdateType;

   enum {
     accepted(0),
     retry(1),
     rejected(2),
     clashed(3),
     (255)
   } ExtendedKeyUpdateResponseStatus;

   struct {
      ExtendedKeyUpdateType update_type;
      select (update_type) {
         case extended_key_update_request: {
             KeyShareEntry key_share;
         }
         case extended_key_update_response: {
             ExtendedKeyUpdateResponseStatus status;
             select (status) {
                case accepted: KeyShareEntry key_share;
                case retry:    uint8 delay;
             }
         }
         case new_key_update: {
             /* empty */
         }
      };
   } ExtendedKeyUpdate;

   Fields:

   *  update_type: the subtype of the ExtendedKeyUpdate message.

   *  key_share: key share information.  The contents of this field are
      determined by the specified group and its corresponding definition
      (see [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis]).

   *  status: response to an extended_key_update_request.  Indicates
      whether the responder accepted or declined the request.

   *  delay: delay in seconds for the initiator to retry the request
      when status == retry.

   There are three rejection reasons:

   1.  retry: request declined temporarily (responder is too busy).  In
       this case the message includes a delay in seconds.  The initiator
       MUST NOT retry within this interval and SHOULD retry after it
       elapses.  The responder MAY apply an overall rate limit not
       specific to a single TLS session.  If the initiator cannot
       proceed without an immediate Extended Key Update it MUST
       terminate the connection with the TLS alert
       "extended_key_update_required" (alert number TBD).

   2.  rejected: request declined permanently.  The initiator MUST NOT
       retry and, if it cannot proceed without Extended Key Update, MUST
       terminate the connection with "extended_key_update_required"
       (alert number TBD).

   3.  clashed: request declined because the responder has already
       initiated its own extended key update.

5.  TLS 1.3 Exchange Steps

   The following steps are taken by a TLS 1.3 implementation; the steps
   executed with DTLS 1.3 differ slightly.

   1.  The initiator sends ExtendedKeyUpdate(request) carrying a
       KeyShareEntry.  While an extended key update is in progress, the
       initiator MUST NOT initiate another key update.

   2.  Upon receipt, the responder sends ExtendedKeyUpdate(response).
       If the responder accepts the request, it sets status=accepted and
       includes its own KeyShareEntry.  If the responder declines, it
       sets the appropriate status and omits the KeyShareEntry.  While
       an extended key update is in progress, the responder MUST NOT
       initiate another key update.

   3.  Upon receipt of an ExtendedKeyUpdate(response) with
       status=accepted, the initiator derives the new secrets from the
       exchanged key shares.  The subsequent
       ExtendedKeyUpdate(new_key_update) is an intentionally empty
       structure that triggers the switch to the new keying material.

   4.  After the initiator sends ExtendedKeyUpdate(new_key_update) it
       MUST update its send keys.  Upon receipt of this message, the
       responder MUST update its receive keys and then send
       ExtendedKeyUpdate(new_key_update), after which it MUST update its
       send keys.

   5.  After receiving the responder’s
       ExtendedKeyUpdate(new_key_update), the initiator MUST update its
       receive keys.

   Both sender and receiver MUST encrypt their
   ExtendedKeyUpdate(new_key_update) messages with the old keys.  Both
   sides MUST ensure that the new_key_update encrypted with the old key
   is received before accepting any messages encrypted with the new key.

   If TLS peers independently initiate the extended key update and the
   requests cross in flight, the ExtendedKeyUpdate(request) with the
   lower lexicographic order of the key_exchange value in KeyShareEntry
   MUST be rejected with status=clashed in the corresponding
   ExtendedKeyUpdate(response).  This prevents each side from advancing
   keys by two generations.

   The handshake framing uses a single HandshakeType for this message
   (see Figure 2).

         struct {
             HandshakeType msg_type;    /* handshake type */
             uint24 length;             /* bytes in message */
             select (Handshake.msg_type) {
                 case client_hello:          ClientHello;
                 case server_hello:          ServerHello;
                 case end_of_early_data:     EndOfEarlyData;
                 case encrypted_extensions:  EncryptedExtensions;
                 case certificate_request:   CertificateRequest;
                 case certificate:           Certificate;
                 case certificate_verify:    CertificateVerify;
                 case finished:              Finished;
                 case new_session_ticket:    NewSessionTicket;
                 case key_update:            KeyUpdate;
                 case extended_key_update:   ExtendedKeyUpdate;
             };
         } Handshake;

                       Figure 2: Handshake Structure.

6.  Updating Traffic Secrets

   When the extended key update message exchange is completed both peers
   have successfully updated their application traffic secrets.  The key
   derivation function described in this document is used to perform
   this update.

   The design of the key derivation function for computing the next
   generation of application_traffic_secret is motivated by the desire
   to include

   *  a secret derived from the (EC)DHE exchange (or from the hybrid key
      exchange / PQ-KEM exchange),

   *  a secret that allows the new key exchange to be cryptographically
      bound to the previously established secret,

   *  the concatenation of the ExtendedKeyUpdate(request) and the
      ExtendedKeyUpdate(response) messages, which contain the key
      shares, binding the encapsulated shared secret ciphertext to IKM
      in case of hybrid key exchange, providing MAL-BIND-K-CT security
      (see [CDM23]), and

   *  new label strings to distinguish it from the key derivation used
      in TLS 1.3.

   The following diagram shows the key derivation hierarchy.

          Master Secret N

                v

                v
    (EC)DHE -> HKDF-Extract = Master Secret N+1
                |
                +-----> Derive-Secret(., "c ap traffic2",
                |                ExtendedKeyUpdate(request) ||
                |                ExtendedKeyUpdate(response))
                |                = client_application_traffic_secret_N+1
                |
                +-----> Derive-Secret(., "s ap traffic2",
                |                ExtendedKeyUpdate(request) ||
                |                ExtendedKeyUpdate(response))
                |                = server_application_traffic_secret_N+1
                |
                +-----> Derive-Secret(., "exp master2",
                |                ExtendedKeyUpdate(request) ||
                |                ExtendedKeyUpdate(response))
                |                = exporter_master_secret_N+1
                |
                +-----> Derive-Secret(., "res master2",
                |                ExtendedKeyUpdate(request) ||
                |                ExtendedKeyUpdate(response))
                                 = resumption_master_secret_N+1

   During the initial handshake, the Master Secret is generated (see
   Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis]).  Since the Master Secret
   is discarded during the key derivation procedure, a derived value is
   stored.  This stored value then serves as the input salt to the first
   key update procedure that incorporates the ephemeral (EC)DHE-
   established value as input keying material (IKM) to produce
   master_secret_{N+1}. The derived value from this new master secret
   serves as input salt to the subsequent key update procedure, which
   also incorporates a fresh ephemeral (EC)DHE value as IKM.  This
   process is repeated for each additional key update procedure.

   The traffic keys are re-derived from
   client_application_traffic_secret_N+1 and
   server_application_traffic_secret_N+1, as described in Section 7.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

   Once client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N+1 and its associated
   traffic keys have been computed, implementations SHOULD delete
   client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N and its associated
   traffic keys as soon as possible.  Note: The client_/
   server_application_traffic_secret_N and its associated traffic keys
   can only be deleted after receiving the
   ExtendedKeyUpdate(new_key_update) message.

   When using this extension, it is important to consider its
   interaction with ticket-based session resumption.  If resumption
   occurs without a new (EC)DH exchange that provides forward secrecy,
   an attacker could potentially revert the security context to an
   earlier state, thereby negating the benefits of the extended key
   update.  To preserve the security guarantees provided by key updates,
   endpoints MUST either invalidate any session tickets issued prior to
   the key update or ensure that resumption always involves a fresh
   (EC)DH exchange.

   If session tickets cannot be stored securely, developers SHOULD
   consider disabling ticket-based resumption in their deployments.
   While this approach may impact performance, it provides improved
   security properties.

7.  Example

   Figure 1 shows the interaction between a TLS 1.3 client and server
   graphically.  This section shows an example message exchange where a
   client updates its sending keys.

   There are two phases:

   1.  The support for the functionality in this specification is
       negotiated in the ClientHello and the EncryptedExtensions
       messages.

   2.  Once the initial handshake is completed, a key update can be
       triggered.

   Figure 3 provides an overview of the exchange starting with the
   initial negotiation followed by the key update.

8.  DTLS 1.3 Considerations

   Due to the possibility of an ExtendedKeyUpdate(new_key_update)
   message being lost and thereby preventing the sender of the message
   from updating its keying material, receivers MUST retain the pre-
   update keying material until receipt and successful decryption of a
   message using the new keys.

   Due to loss and/or reordering, DTLS 1.3 implementations may receive a
   record with an older epoch than the current one.  They SHOULD attempt
   to process those records with that epoch but MAY opt to discard such
   out-of-epoch records.

9.  Post-Quantum Cryptography Considerations

   Hybrid key exchange refers to the simultaneous use of multiple key
   exchange algorithms, with the resulting shared secret derived by
   combining the outputs of each.  The goal of this approach is to
   maintain security even if all but one of the component algorithms are
   later found to be vulnerable.

   The transition to post-quantum cryptography has motivated the
   adoption of hybrid key exchanges in TLS, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design].  Specific hybrid groups have been
   registered in [I-D.ietf-tls-ecdhe-mlkem].  When hybrid key exchange
   is used, the key_exchange field of each KeyShareEntry in the initial
   handshake is formed by concatenating the key_exchange fields of the
   constituent algorithms.  This same approach is reused during the
   Extended Key Update, when new key shares are exchanged.

   The specification in [I-D.ietf-tls-mlkem] registers the lattice-based
   ML-KEM algorithm and its variants, such as ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768 and
   ML-KEM-1024.  The KEM encapsulation key or KEM ciphertext is
   represented as a 'KeyShareEntry' field.  This same approach is reused
   during the Extended Key Update, when new key shares are exchanged.

10.  SSLKEYLOGFILE Update

   As a successful extended key update exchange invalidates previous
   secrets, SSLKEYLOGFILE [I-D.ietf-tls-keylogfile] needs to be
   populated with new entries.  As a result, two additional secret
   labels are utilized in the SSLKEYLOGFILE:

   1.  CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_N+1: identifies the
       client_application_traffic_secret_N+1 in the key schedule

   2.  SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_N+1: identifies the
       server_application_traffic_secret_N+1 in the key schedule

   Similar to other entries in the SSLKEYLOGFILE, the label is followed
   by the 32-byte value of the Random field from the ClientHello message
   that established the TLS connection, and the corresponding secret
   encoded in hexadecimal.

   SSLKEYLOGFILE entries for the extended key update MUST NOT be
   produced if SSLKEYLOGFILE was not used for other secrets in the
   handshake.

   Note that each successful Extended Key Update invalidates all
   previous SSLKEYLOGFILE secrets including past iterations of
   CLIENT_TRAFFIC_SECRET_ and SERVER_TRAFFIC_SECRET_.

11.  Exporter

   Protocols like DTLS-SRTP and DTLS-over-SCTP utilize TLS or DTLS for
   key establishment but repurpose some of the keying material for their
   own purpose.  These protocols use the TLS exporter defined in
   Section 7.5 of [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis].

   Once the Extended Key Update mechanism is complete, such protocols
   would need to use the newly derived key to generate Exported Keying
   Material (EKM) to protect packets.  The "sk" derived in the Section 6
   will be used as the "Secret" in the exporter function, defined in
   Section 7.5 of [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis], to generate EKM, ensuring
   that the exported keying material is aligned with the updated
   security context.

   This entire document is about security.

13.  IANA Considerations

13.1.  TLS Alerts

   IANA is requested to allocate value TBD for the
   "extended_key_update_required" alert in the "TLS Alerts" registry.
   The value for the "DTLS-OK" column is "Y".

13.2.  TLS Flags

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "TLS Flags"
   extension registry [TLS-Ext-Registry]:

   *  Value: TBD1

   *  Flag Name: extended_key_update

   *  Messages: CH, EE

   *  Recommended: Y

   *  Reference: [This document]

13.3.  TLS HandshakeType

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "TLS
   HandshakeType" registry [TLS-Ext-Registry]:

   *  Value: TBD2

   *  Description: extended_key_update

   *  DTLS-OK: Y

   *  Reference: [This document]

   Note: The subtypes extended_key_update_request,
   extended_key_update_response, and new_key_update are internal to the
   ExtendedKeyUpdate message and do not require separate HandshakeType
   code points.
